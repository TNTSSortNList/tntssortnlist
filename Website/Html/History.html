                    Tagum National Trade School began its emergence when Hon. Lorenzo P. Sarmiento, 1972 congressman of Davao del Norte framed a bill. He thought the need of the province particularly in the municipality of Tagum, now Tagum City, to have a vocational school to resolve the poor enrollment to formal education of the less fortunate group. 
                    In that same year, the bill becomes a law - R.A. 5986[3] as its legal basis of the school’s establishment. Tagum National Trade School begun operating on August 1, 1972 with its temporary classroom the Tagum Community gym situated beside the Southern Philippines Medical Center, now Davao Regional Hospital, at Apokon, Tagum City. 
                    The seventy-eight (78) first year high school excess enrollees of Tagum Municipal High School and two teachers served as the pioneering batch. As approved by DECS Order No. 28 as mandated by Batas Pambansa of 1975, the inaugural of the Post-Secondary Vocational Courses as the Two-Year Trade Technical Education curriculum started on 1976.
                    In 1989, the institution adopted the technical-vocational program under the Bureau of Technical-Vocational Education (BTVE). The school also was considered priority 1 in all vocational public schools based on the DECS Order 56, 59 and 62. Automotive Technology became the leading course followed by, electronics technology, electrical technology, civil technology, refrigeration and air-conditioning technology, etc. 
                    The secondary level eventually followed New Secondary Education Curriculum. The implementation of R.A. 7796[4] in 1995, creating the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) prepared Tagum National Trade School as one of its superior Technical Vocational Training (TVI’s) in Region XI. Teachers were sent for Massive trainings to the National Training Center. 
                    Thus, technology courses were offered and more enrollees in college rolled in. In 2007, the Department of Education (DepEd) implemented the “Strengthen Technical-Vocational Education Program (STVEP)” and Tagum National Trade School was identified one of tech-voc secondary public schools out of 282 across the country to implement the Competency-Based Curriculum and offered different areas of specialization in both Arts and Trade.
                    All through years, the school has gained admiration, pride and integrity from the constituent of Davao Region. Since 1996 the school became the first school offering computer literacy to its clients in the secondary level by including computer subjects in their curriculum.
